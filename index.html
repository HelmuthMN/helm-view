                Welcome to the N.H.K. (Japanese: N・H・Kにようこそ!, Hepburn: N.H.K. ni Yōkoso!) is a Japanese novel written by
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatsuhiko_Takimoto" target="_blank">Tatsuhiko Takimoto</a>,
                with a cover illustration by Yoshitoshi ABe, and was published by Kadokawa Shoten in Japan on January
                28, 2002. The novel was first published in English by Tokyopop
                on October 9, 2007. The story revolves around a 22-year-old hikikomori, an asocial recluse, who gets aid
                from a strange girl who seems to know a lot about him, despite never having
                met him before. Common themes throughout the story deal with depression, isolation, existential dread,
                the hardships of life and how people must deal with them in their own way. The novel analyzes profusely
                the hikikomori phenomenon, which is relatively widespread in Japan.
